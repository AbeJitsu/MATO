As the market moves toward equilibrium, builders construct more buildings to meet the unmet demand"
FL-RELEP,15.13,Why is real estate traditionally considered a relatively illiquid economic product?,Its physical form is fixed,"Real estate is defined as land, not water",It is often difficult to convert to cash,It cannot be moved,c,"Since real estate is often a large, long-term investment that has no exact duplicate, the process of a buyer’s evaluating and choosing the right property is long and complex; hence, finding a buyer at a desired price can take a long time"

FL-RELEP,16.1,"Bill Parsons paid $150,000 for a house to operate as a rental property, figuring that he could rent it out at a rate of $900 a month. In paying a price based on the property’s ability to generate a desired future income, Parsons was motivated by the economic principle known as",substitution,anticipation,supply and demand,utility,b,"Anticipation is the value principle that a buyer will pay a price based on the benefits the buyer expects to derive from a property over a holding period.  For example, if an investor anticipates an annual rental income from a leased property to be one million dollars, this expected sum has a direct bearing on what the investor will pay for the property"
FL-RELEP,16.2,Which of the following situations illustrates the principle of contribution?,A homebuyer makes a down payment of 20% instead of the 10% the lender requires,"A homeowner adds a third bathroom to a house and thereby increases the appraised value by $10,000","The appraised value of a house goes up by $20,000 over a two-year period because of the prices recently paid for other houses in the neighborhood","Because of a decline in mortgage interest rates, a homeowner in a certain market is able to list her house at a higher price",b,"The principle of contribution focuses on the degree to which a particular improvement affects market value of the overall property.  In essence, the contribution of the improvement is equal to the change in market value that the addition of the improvement causes.  For example, adding a bathroom to a house may contribute an additional $15,000 to the appraised value.  Thus the contribution of the bathroom is $15,000"
FL-RELEP,16.3,"When a property owner combines two adjacent properties to create a single property with a higher value than the sum of the values of the two separate properties, the applicable principle of value is called",assemblage,accretion,progression,subdivision,a,"Assemblage, or the conjoining of adjacent properties, sometimes creates a combined value that is greater than the values of the unassembled properties.  The excess value created by assemblage is called plottage value"
FL-RELEP,16.4,"What is the difference between market value and market price, if any?",There is no difference,Market value is a broker’s estimate; market price is a precise number derived by a licensed appraiser,Market value is an average price derived from comparable sales; market price is a price based on the cost of creating the property,Market value is an estimate; market price is the price at which a property sold,d,"Market value is an estimate of the price at which a property will sell at a particular time. The market price, as opposed to market value, is what a property actually sells for. Market price should theoretically be the same as market value if all the conditions essential for market value are present.  Market price, however, may not reflect the analysis of comparables and of investment value that an estimate of market value includes"
FL-RELEP,16.5,"The first step in the appraisal process, regardless of the appraisal method, is to",identify the highest and best use of the property to be appraised,collect and analyze property data,estimate the value of the land as if it were vacant,define the appraisal problem and the purpose of the appraisal,d,The first step in the process is to define the appraisal problem and the purpose of the appraisal.  This involves identifying the subject property by legal description; specifying the interest to be appraised; specifying the purpose of the appraisal; specifying the date for which the appraisal is valid; and identifying the type of value to be estimated
FL-RELEP,16.6,"In the final step of an appraisal, the appraiser reconciles the value estimates derived by the various appraisal approaches by",disregarding the high and low extreme results,averaging the results of all three approaches,weighing the applicability of the approaches and considering the quality of data supporting each approach,choosing the result that is closest to the average for properties in the immediate neighborhood,c,"The final step in the appraisal process is to reconcile the value estimates produced by the three approaches to value into a final value estimate.  To do this, an appraiser must weigh the appropriateness of a particular approach to the type of property being appraised and take into account the quality and quantity of data obtained in each method"
FL-RELEP,16.7,Which of the following statements properly describes the central concept of the sales comparison approach?,Find the median price of recently sold comparable properties and add or subtract dollar amounts in the subject property to account for competitive differences,Make dollar adjustments to the sale prices of comparable properties to account for competitive differences with the subject,Find at least three comparable properties that are currently for sale and make dollar adjustments to the listing prices to account for competitive differences with the subject,Apply an appreciation factor to the price at which the subject property most recently sold and make dollar adjustments to account for competitive differences with comparable properties currently for sale,b,"The sales comparison approach consists of comparing sale prices of recently sold properties that are comparable with the subject, and making dollar adjustments to the price of each comparable to account for competitive differences with the subject.  After identifying the adjusted value of each comparable, the appraiser weights the reliability of each comparable and the factors underlying how the adjustments were made.   The weighting yields a final value range based on the most reliable factors in the analysis"
FL-RELEP,16.8,One of the strengths of the sales comparison approach is that it,takes into account the subject property's investment value,reveals the profit margin of the builder or developer of the subject property,discovers the underlying value of the subject property apart from the influence of competing properties,takes into account the competitive value of specific amenities of the subject property,d,"The sales comparison approach is widely used because it takes into account the subject property's specific amenities in relation to competing properties.  In addition, because of the currency of its data, the approach incorporates present market realities"
FL-RELEP,16.9,"In making dollar adjustments in the sales comparison approach, the appraiser",adds value to a comparable that is inferior to the subject property,adds value to the subject property if it is inferior to a comparable,subtracts value from a comparable that is inferior to the subject property,subtracts value from the subject property if it is inferior to a comparable,a,"If the comparable is inferior to the subject in some characteristic, an amount is added to the price of the comparable. If the comparable is better than the subject in some characteristic, an amount is deducted from the sale price of the comparable.  This neutralizes the comparable's competitive advantage or disadvantage in an adjustment category. For example, a comparable has a swimming pool and the subject does not.  To equalize the difference, the appraiser deducts an amount, say $6,000, from the sale price of the comparable"
FL-RELEP,16.10,The best comparable property for use in the sales comparison approach is the one that,requires the most and largest adjustments,requires the fewest and smallest adjustments,sold most recently at the highest price,is located closest to the subject property,b,"As a rule, the fewer the total number of adjustments, the smaller the adjustment amounts, and the less the total adjustment amount, the more reliable the comparable"
FL-RELEP,16.11,"A house is being appraised using the sales comparison approach.  The house has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a patio.  The appraiser selects a comparable house that has three bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, and no patio.  The comparable house just sold for $200,000. A bath is valued at $7,000, and a patio at $2,000.  Assuming all else is equal, what is the adjusted value of the comparable?","$202,000 ","$207,000 ","$195,000 ","$205,000 ",c,"Since the comparable has an extra bath, it is adjusted downward to equalize with the subject.  Conversely, since it has no patio, the appraiser adds value to the comparable.  Thus, $200,000 minus $7,000 plus $2,000 equals $195,000"
FL-RELEP,16.12,Which of the following statements properly describes the central methodology of the cost approach to appraisal?,Apply a depreciation factor to the reported actual cost of acquiring and improving the subject property,Estimate the cost of building the improvements on the subject property,Estimate the land value and add to this the actual cost of the improvements adjusted for competitive differences with similar properties,Add the estimated land value and cost of improvements and subtract the accrued depreciation of the improvements,d,"The cost approach consists of estimating the value of the land ""as if vacant;"" estimating the cost of improvements; estimating and deducting accrued depreciation; and adding the estimated land value to the estimated depreciated cost of the improvements"
FL-RELEP,16.13,One of the strengths of the cost approach is that it,takes into account the amount of money required to develop a similar property,is very accurate for a property with new improvements that represent the highest and best use,results in an actual price in dollars instead of an estimated value,reveals the owner's return on money invested in the cost of development,b,The strengths of the cost approach are that it: provides an upper limit for the subject's value based on the undepreciated cost of reproducing the improvements.  It is also very accurate for valuing a property with new improvements which are the highest and best use of the property
FL-RELEP,16.14,The principle underlying depreciation from physical deterioration is that,"eventually, a property loses all of its value",a property loses a portion of its value each year because of economic obsolescence,a property loses the same increment of value each year over the economic life of the property,the value lost to depreciation is incurable,c,"All property improvements have an economic life, which becomes incrementally shorter year after year as physical deterioration takes its toll. The property as a whole does not lose value, since land itself does not depreciate.  Similarly, an improvement can regain value if it is repaired or updated.   Finally, not all properties lose value from economic obsolescence"
FL-RELEP,16.15,"A property is being appraised by the cost approach.  The appraiser estimates that the land is worth $30,000 and the replacement cost of the improvements is $95,000.

Thus you have $30,000 + ($95,000 - 10,000), or $115,000"
FL-RELEP,16.16,Which of the following statements properly describes how to apply the income capitalization approach to appraisal?,Apply a rate of return to the price paid for an income property,Divide the income a property generates by a rate of return,Estimate the amount of income a property must generate to return the capital amount invested in it,Estimate the rate of return a property owner receives from income generated by the property,b,"An appraiser obtains an indication of value from the income capitalization method by dividing the estimated net operating income for the subject by the rate of return, or capitalization rate.  The formula is: NOI / Cap rate = Value"
FL-RELEP,16.17,A strength of the income capitalization approach is that it,uses a rate of return that is required for all potential purchasers in a market,yields an accurate projection of investment income,uses a method that is also used by investors to determine how much they should pay for an investment property,can be used with any type of property in any market,c,"The strength of the income approach is that it is used by investors themselves to determine how much they should pay for a property.  Thus, in the right circumstances, it provides a good basis for estimating market value.  The approach, however, does not project what an income property's future income will be.  Moreover, it is not an applicable method for estimating value if the subject is a non-income producing property"
FL-RELEP,16.18,"A property is being appraised using the income capitalization approach.  Annually, it has an estimated gross income of $60,000, vacancy and credit losses of $3,000, and operating expenses of $20,000.

What is its monthly gross rent multiplier?",12.5,0.01,0.08,150,d,"The monthly gross rent multiplier for a property is equal to the price divided by the monthly rent.  Thus, ($450,000 ÷ $3,000) = 150"
FL-RELEP,16.20,"A rental house has monthly gross income of $1,200.  A suitable gross income multiplier derived from market data is 14.1.

An adjoining property owner, Ken, had tried to buy the property for $185,000, but had been refused.  He now offers Lynne $190,000 for the house. Lynne is interested, so she hires an appraiser. The appraiser returns an estimate of value of $200,000. Which of these numbers can be called the market value?","$187,500 ","$190,000 ","$195,000 ","$200,000 ",d,"Market value is an opinion of the price that a willing seller and willing buyer would probably agree on for a property at a given time if:  the transaction is for cash; the property is exposed on the open market for a reasonable period; buyer and seller have full information about market conditions ; there is no abnormal pressure on either party;  it is an ""arm's length"" transaction; title is marketable; and the price does not include hidden influences such as special financing deals. The amount Lynne actually paid is the market price. The previous listing price and Ken's offer might be interesting data for the appraiser, but the appraisal must also consider other market data, such as comparable sales"
FL-RELEP,16.26,A notable weakness of the sales comparison approach to value is that,there may be no recent sale price data in the market,the approach is not based on the principle of substitution,"the approach is only accurate with unique, special purpose properties","sale prices cannot be compared, since all real estate is different",a,"The sales comparison approach is limited in that every property is unique.  As a result, it is difficult to find good comparables, especially for special-purpose properties.  In addition, the market must be active; otherwise, sale prices lack currency and reliability"
FL-RELEP,16.27,"In the market data approach, an appraiser","chooses nearby comparables, adjusts the subject for differences, and estimates the value","gathers relevant price data, applies the data to the subject, and estimates the value","selects comparable properties, adjusts the comparables, and estimates the value","identifies the price previously paid, applies an appreciation rate, and estimates the value",c,"The steps are to first identify comparable sales; then compare comparables to the subject and make adjustments to comparables; then, finally, weigh values indicated by adjusted comparables for the final value estimate of the subject"

An adjustment may be made for such differences as mortgage loan terms, mortgage assumability, and owner financing"
FL-RELEP,16.29,"To complete the sales comparison approach, the appraiser",averages the comparable values,weights the comparables,identifies the subject’s value as that of the middle value of the comparables,identifies the subject's value as that of the nearest comparable,b,"The last step in the approach is to perform a weighted analysis of the indicated values of each comparable.  The appraiser, in other words, must identify which comparable values are more indicative of the subject and which are less indicative. However, all comparables are taken into account, not simply the nearest comparable"
FL-RELEP,16.30,One weakness of the cost approach for appraising market value is that,builders may not pay market value for materials or labor,market value is not always the same as what the property cost,comparables used may not have similar quality of construction,new properties have inestimable costs and rates of depreciation,b,"The limitations of the cost approach are that: the cost to create improvements is not necessarily the same as market value; and depreciation is difficult to measure, especially for older buildings"
FL-RELEP,16.31,The cost of constructing a functional equivalent of a subject property is known as,reproduction cost,replacement cost,restitution cost,reconstruction cost,b,"Reproduction cost is the cost of constructing, at current prices, a precise duplicate of the subject improvements.
